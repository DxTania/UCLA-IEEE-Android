## UCLA IEEE Android app

* Backend can be found here: {https://github.com/DxTania/ucla-ieee-server}
* Uses material design basics
* News feed, calendar, membership
* QR code check-in for members to gain points at our events

## General Board!

Here are some things that would be cool to get done

* [GCM push notifications](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html) for our events 
  * Ask me about questions for the calendar API
  * I can help with GCM but I've never used it
* Leaderboards
  * Backend code is mostly done and can be found [here](https://github.com/DxTania/ucla-ieee-server/blob/master/include/user_db_functions.php)
  * Needs to filter out officers who have extraneous points
  * Android: Hook up a UI and make a few network calls
  * Ask me for help on any of this
* Cash in points through the app
  * Can preliminarily just send an email 
  * Modify Rewards UI to create this email, for example be able to click on a reward in order to send the email that asks for the current user to get the reward
  * Would be cooler if it also made calls to deduct points
  * Ask me for help on any of this
* Make the app look prettier
  * I really have no idea
  * Don't ask me for help, but I can tell you if I think something looks bad or not
* Whatever you can think of!
  * Lab hours incorporation
  * Social networking and messaging
  * ...
